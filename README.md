# GuiltyGearUE5-Shader
Easy copy-paste of my Guilty Gear inspired shader for UE5.
I used Unreal Engine 5.2.1

Here you'll find a copy paste of the shader; It uses all default engine texture and function so it should work with no problem even on UE4.
In the project you'll find the Master Material plus the Outline and Decal Master Materials as well as blueprints to shade the models when they are in shadow. (It's a concept to show how it works, feel free to change it how you need it).

The Material also support individual lighting per character, there is also and exemple of that.

All the models and assets are property of Arc System Works; They are in the project just for study purpose, i'll delete them immediately if they can cause any problem.
